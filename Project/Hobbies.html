I am a certified classical Carnatic music singer and I have been learning Carnatic music for the past 15 years. I enjoy singing and giving performances as well as teaching 
students. In my free time I also like to work on volunteer projects for non-profit companies by helping them with front end or back end development.<br>
Apart from my academic work I love to learn and work on new hobbies during my free time. A few of my hobbies include cooking, swimming, hiking and reading historical fiction
books. I also enjoy working on DIY projects and I love to work on projects which challenge me creatively.
