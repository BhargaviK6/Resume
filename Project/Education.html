I completed my Undergraduate overseas in India. I graduated from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad in 2015 with a Bachelor of Technology degree
in Computer Science & Engineering. During the course of my Undergrad I took courses which covered a span of topics in Computer Science. Some of the most memorable courses 
which I felt impacted me the most were Digital Logic Design, Compiler Design and Operating Systems. Though digital logic design would be considered more of an electrical engineering
topic, I felt that by know how the computer manipulated bits to execute instructions helped me understand their importance in programming.



I am currently a full time graduate student at Santa Clara University. I am pursuing a degree
in Master of Science in Computer Science & Engineering. Some of the courses I have taken include:
<ul>
<li>	1. Computer Architecture COEN 210</li>
<li>	2. Computer Networks COEN 233</li>
<li>	3. Design and Analyis of Algorithms COEN 279</li>
<li>	4. Web Programming1 COEN 276</li>
<li>	5. Secure Coding in C & C++ </li>
<li>	6. Database Systems COEN 280</li>
<li>	7. Object Oriented Design  COEN 275</li>
<li>8. Software Development COEN 287</li>

</ul>
