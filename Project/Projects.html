TCP/IP Socket programming:<br>
In this project I created a client server connection between two programs. 
This project was built win three different steps and initially by using the Secure File Transfer Protocol and the Stop and Wait protocol I was 
able to establish the client server connection and transfer both ASCII and binary files. I applied concepts such as byte size manipulation and 
checksum functions to ensure the reliability of the connection.<br>
Environment: GNU C compiler on Ubuntu 14.04.03 Operating System.<br><br>
Single Cycle CPU Implementation<br>
I developed and simulated a Verilog/VHDL design of
 a microprocessor for a single cycle instruction set and logically created the function of the CPU. I developed the individual 
 modules for the Instruction Memory, Data Memory, Register file and others. Then using data paths I interconnected the modules. 
 My design was able to process R-type, I-type and J-type instructions.<br>
Environment: Quartus II with Modelsim-Altera along with Cyclone IV on Windows 10.
